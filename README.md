# Tmog
Addon for TurtleWoW that adds information about your transmog collection on item tooltips. Comes with Item Browser where you can search and try on all items in the game and make outfits.<br>

## Instruction
Download addon, extract into Interface/Addons, remove `-master`, folder should be named `Tmog`.<br>

If this is first time using addon you need to cache your existing transmog collection. Go to fashionista in Stormwind or Orgrimmar, click on every item slot, you need to do this for all weapon types (two-hand, polearms, staves, one-hand swords/axes/maces, daggers, shields, off-hand holdables, wands, crossbows, bows, guns).<br>
For example if you have transmogs for daggers and polearms, you need to equip any dagger, go to transmog npc and click on dagger, then equip any polearm, talk to npc again, click on polearm. Repeat for other weapon types that you have.
For armor slots clicking once should be enough.<br>

If you have multiple transmogged gear pieces for a given slot, you need to talk to fashionista while wearing each of these gear pieces.
